		<p><em>This is a place for me to post the odd coding projects that I am doing</em>, and explain how I did it for those who want to do it for themselves regardless of the programming language you use. I include all the resources that I used to figure it out, as well as explain it myself. I hope someone finds this helpful.</p>

		<p>It is done by looping through each pixel, and applying the following rule to it. if there are more than the threshhold of the same type pixels ajacent to it (diagonals included), the current pixel is unchanged, if the number of different pixels is more than the threshold, its type is swapped. Set the threshold to 4 or 5 for best results making the shapes above, but some interesting shapes can be made by using other numbers as well. You have to leave a buffer around the edge of the pattern as well, and preform the rule excluding the edge peices. This can also be used to determine what the outside counts as, I generally prefer to leave the edges as 'off'</p>

		<p>The process is started by randomly filling the grid with 'on' and 'off' cells. You can use a random chance (I tended to use 47%) or use some other method like perlin noise to distribute them. Then the above rule is applied multiple times to the cells, 4-5 times is usually enough for decent results but you might want to do it as many as 16 times.</p>
		<code>generating_initial_noise = true;
applying_the_rule = false;

repeat ammount_of_detail {
	for every_pixel {
		if generating_initial_noise {
			this_pixel.type = xx%_chance // Chance of being 'on' or 'off'
		}
		
		if applying_the_rule {
			neighbors = count_ajacent_pixels_of_same(type);
			
			if neighbors > threshold {
				this_pixel.type = !this_pixel.type;  // Swap the type
			}
			
			draw_to_display();
		}
	}

			I spent a few hour's making a <a href="#">This is a Link</a> 
			program to plot it. It takes the equation xn+1 = rxn(1 - xn) or  
			<code>new_value = r * current_value * (1 - current_value)</code> 
			written in code (a population modelling equation that mostly stabilises 
			as a consistent value or a cycle of values), and plots the results of 
			few hundred iterations on one column of the diagram, and then 
			increases the variable r <em>(the reproductive number)</em> by 
			a small amount before repeating the process for the next column. 
			The top variation has the equation plotted only after the results 
			stabilise (<code>ignore_first_values = true</code>), and the bottom 
			version includes the points before the stabilisation as well 
			(<code>ignore_first_values = false</code>).
