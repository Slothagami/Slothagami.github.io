					This is a place for me to post the odd coding projects that I am doing, 
					and explain how I did it for those who want to do it for themselves 
					regardless of the programming language you use. I 
					include all the resources that I used to figure it out, as well as explain
					it myself. I hope someone finds this helpful.

					<div class="project-article">
						<p>
							A version of <em>Cellular Automata</em> that can be used for making cave or 
							island shapes. This one isn't too difficult to do, but there are 
							some tricks to it.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							It is done by looping through each pixel, and applying the following 
							rule to it. if there are more than the threshhold of the same type pixels ajacent
							to it (diagonals included),
							the current pixel is unchanged, if the number of different pixels is more
							than the threshold, its type is swapped. <em>Set the threshold to 4 or 5 for 
							best results</em> making the shapes above, but some interesting shapes can be made
							by using other numbers as well. <em>You have to leave a buffer around the edge of the 
							pattern as well</em>, and preform the rule excluding the edge peices. This can also 
							be used to determine what the outside counts as, I generally prefer to leave the edges
							as 'off'.
						</p>
						<br />
						
						
						<img src="images/posts/cellCaves.png" class="square-image" />
						
						<br />
						<br />
						<p>
							The process is started by randomly filling the grid with 'on' and 'off' cells.
							You can use a random chance <em>(I tended to use 47%)</em> or use some
							other method like perlin noise to distribute them. Then the above rule is applied 
							<em>multiple times</em> to the cells, 4-5 times is usually enough for decent results 
							but you might want to do it as many as 16 times.

						This version of inverse kinematics isn't the most accurate, but it's easier so understand compared
						to the other version, and has the benefit of being able to bend each individual joint in any 
						direction, at the cost of not being able to control that direction.
					</p>
					<br />
					
					<img src="images/posts/wigglyIKrecording.gif" class="square-image" id="wIKimg" />
					
					<br />

					<p>
						It works by looping through each segment from front to back, and for each one, pointing in the direction
						of it's target (either the main target or the end of the previous segment) and moving one end to meet
						it there. It then moves the whole thing back to the anchored position.

						This version of inverse kinematics is more complicated to make than the one above, 
						the benifit being that you can flip the direction the arm bends, and it is
						more accurate than the other version.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						This version of inverse kinematics works with Trigonometry, 
						using the <em> Law of Cosines </em> to compute
						the angles of the joints.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Law of Cosines says that 
						<span class="textcodeexample"> 
							&theta; = 
							<span class="function"> cos <sup> -1 </sup></span>
							 (
							 <span class="frac">
							 	<span>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup> </span>
								<span class="symbol"> / </span>
								<span class="bottom"> 2ab </span>
							 </span>
							 ) 
						</span>
						where a, b and c are the side lengths of the triangle and &theta; is the angle. In code it looks like this: 
						<span class="textcodeexample"><code>&theta; = <span class="function">arccos</span>((a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2*a*b))</code></span>
						<em> c is the side length opposite the angle you want </em> the a & b can be either of the remaining sides.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<span class="number">
						I am currently working on this, so the explanation here is not complete yet. 
						I will continue to update this post as I learn for myself how it works.
