				<h3 class="project-head"> Cellular Automata Caves </h3> <!-- 15july2020 -->
					<div class="project-article">
						<p>
							A version of <em>Cellular Automata</em> that can be used for making cave or 
							island shapes. This one isn't too difficult to do, but there are 
							some tricks to it.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							It is done by looping through each pixel, and applying the following 
							rule to it. if there are more than the threshhold of the same type pixels ajacent
							to it (diagonals included),
							the current pixel is unchanged, if the number of different pixels is more
							than the threshold, its type is swapped. <em>Set the threshold to 4 or 5 for 
							best results</em> making the shapes above, but some interesting shapes can be made
							by using other numbers as well. <em>You have to leave a buffer around the edge of the 
							pattern as well</em>, and preform the rule excluding the edge peices. This can also 
							be used to determine what the outside counts as, I generally prefer to leave the edges
							as 'off'.
						</p>
						<br />
						
						
						<img src="images/posts/cellCaves.png" class="square-image" />
						
						<br />
						<br />
						<p>
							The process is started by randomly filling the grid with 'on' and 'off' cells.
							You can use a random chance <em>(I tended to use 47%)</em> or use some
							other method like perlin noise to distribute them. Then the above rule is applied 
							<em>multiple times</em> to the cells, 4-5 times is usually enough for decent results 
							but you might want to do it as many as 16 times.

				<div class="project-article">
					<p> 
						This version of inverse kinematics isn't the most accurate, but it's easier so understand compared
						to the other version, and has the benefit of being able to bend each individual joint in any 
						direction, at the cost of not being able to control that direction.

						It works by looping through each segment from front to back, and for each one, pointing in the direction
						of it's target (either the main target or the end of the previous segment) and moving one end to meet
						it there. It then moves the whole thing back to the anchored position.

					<p>
						This version of inverse kinematics is more complicated to make than the one above, 
						the benifit being that you can flip the direction the arm bends, and it is
						more accurate than the other version.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						This version of inverse kinematics works with Trigonometry, 
						using the <em> Law of Cosines </em> to compute
						the angles of the joints.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Law of Cosines says that 
						<span class="textcodeexample"> 
							&theta; = 
							<span class="function"> cos <sup> -1 </sup></span>
							 (
							 <span class="frac">
							 	<span>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup> </span>
								<span class="symbol"> / </span>
								<span class="bottom"> 2ab </span>
							 </span>
							 ) 
						</span>
						where a, b and c are the side lengths of the triangle and &theta; is the angle. In code it looks like this: 
						<span class="textcodeexample"><code>&theta; = <span class="function">arccos</span>((a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2*a*b))</code></span>
						<em> c is the side length opposite the angle you want </em> the a & b can be either of the remaining sides.
					</p>

						I am currently working on this, so the explanation here is not complete yet. 
						I will continue to update this post as I learn for myself how it works.

				<h3 class="project-head"> Mandlebrot Set </h3> <!-- 20th of November 2020 -->
				<div class="project-article">
					<p>
						This one has a little bit of fancy math involved, but it's actually not that bad!
						The Mandlebrot set is generated using only one equation!
						<em> z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c </em>
						Where <em>z & c are complex numbers</em>.
						<em>z is the number to be ckecked against</em> and 
						<em>c is the position of the point</em> to be checked.					
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Hold on, What are complex numbers? <em>complex numbers are like an x and a y value in the same number</em>
						They are usually written as r + mi, Where <em>r stands for the real (x)</em> component, and 
						<em>m stands for the imaginary
						(y)</em> component of the number. and i is the imaginary number (we can pretty much ignore that though). an example
						of a complex number would be 5 + 7i. 
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Each point of the set is a result of a test based on the equation above, run about 200-300 times, 
						and mapped to the screen. <em>(the set starts at -2 and ends at 2 on both axes)</em>
						Basically for every point you run the equation a few hundred times, and test the angular distance to 0,0 
						to see if it's greater than 2, if it is, you can color that point the background color, otherwise, it's in
						the set! you can color it the set color!
					</p>
					<br />
					
					<img src="images/posts/Mandlebrot set.png" />
					
					<br />
					<p>
						<em>But that will only get you the inner part.</em> To get the colors on the outside, the parts that
						go out further than two, you need to <em>count how many iterations it took to get that far away</em>
						(you can just return the 'i' in your for loop when it get's too far away) and color the outside pixels 
						based on that number.
