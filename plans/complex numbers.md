# Rotation
dividing subtracts angles
divide -1 by itself half a time ( (-1)^(1/2) ) to get half the angle

rotate any amount (show exponents can interpolate angles)
    justify how it lines up with radians in base e (remove real, scaling part)
    justify not using fractional powers of -1
prove eulers idenity

# Uses
Show series mandlebrot, zeta function in real time, link to mandlebrot page?
