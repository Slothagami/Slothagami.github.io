        <h1 id='cellular-automata'>Cellular Automata Caves</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                A version of Cellular Automata that can be used for 
                making cave or island shapes. This one isn't too 
                difficult to do, but there are some tricks to it.
            </p>

                It is done by looping through each pixel, and applying 
                the following rule to it. if there are more than the 
                threshhold of the same type pixels ajacent to it 
                (diagonals included), the current pixel is unchanged, 
                if the number of different pixels is more than the 
                threshold, its type is swapped. <em>Set the threshold to 4 
                or 5 for best results</em> making the shapes above, but some 
                interesting shapes can be made by using other numbers 
                as well. <em>You have to leave a buffer around the edge of 
                the pattern as well</em>, and preform the rule excluding the 
                edge peices. This can also be used to determine what the 
                outside counts as, I generally prefer to leave the edges 
                as 'off'.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/projects/cellCaves.png" alt="What the result looks like" class="smaller">
            <p>
                The process is started by randomly filling the grid with 'on' 
                and 'off' cells. You can use a random chance <em>(I tended to use 47%)</em>
                or use some other method like perlin noise to distribute them. 
                Then the above rule is applied <em>multiple times</em> to the cells, 4-5 
                times is usually enough for decent results but you might want to 
                do it as many as 16 times.

                A population modelling equation that mostly stabilises as a 
                consistent value or a cycle of values, the program takes the equation,
                <code class='math'>x ⇌ rx(1 - x)</code>, plots the results 
                of a few hundred iterations on one column of the diagram, and 
                then increases the variable r (the reproductive number) by a 
                small amount before repeating the process for the next column. 
                The top variation has the equation plotted only after the results 
                stabilise (<code>ignore_first_values = true</code>), and the bottom version 
                includes the points before the stabilisation as well
                (<code>ignore_first_values = false</code>).

            <p>
                This version of inverse kinematics isn't the most accurate, 
                but it's easier so understand compared to the other version, 
                and has the benefit of being able to bend each individual 
                joint in any direction, at the cost of not being able to control 
                that direction.

                It works by looping through each segment from front to back, and for 
                each one, pointing in the direction of it's target (either the main 
                target or the end of the previous segment) and moving one end to meet 
                it there. It then moves the whole thing back to the anchored position.
            </p>

	update_target_position();
	
	if i != 0 {

        <h1 id='mandlebrot-set'>Mandlebrot Set</h1>
        <!--Needs Expanding for Julias sets-->
        <article>
            <p>
                This one has a little bit of fancy math involved, 
                but it's actually not that bad once you understand it.
                The Mandlebrot set is generated using only one equation:
                <code class='math'>z ⇌ z<sup>2</sup> + c </code>
                Where 
                <em><code>z</code> & <code>c</code> are complex numbers.</em> 
                <code>z</code> is the number to be ckecked against and 
                <em><code>c</code> is the position</em> of the point to be checked.
            </p>
            <h2>Complex Numbers</h2>
            <p>
                Complex numbers are an incredibly interesting math concept, but 
                for our purposes, they're like a <code class='math'>Vector2</code>
                (usually written as <code>x + yi</code>, where <code>i</code> is the
                imaginary unit (but you can ignore that when coding)) that has a special way you 
                need to operate on it. Below are the special 
                methods relevant to this project:
            </p>
            <code class='math'>
ComplexNumber = (<span class='-keyword'>realPart</span> + <span class='-builtin'>imaginaryPart</span> * i)

<span class='-comment'>// Addition</span>
(<span class='-keyword'>a</span> + <span class='-builtin'>b</span>*i) + (<span class='-keyword'>c</span> + <span class='-builtin'>d</span>*i) = (<span class='-keyword'>a+c</span> + <span class='-builtin'>b+d</span> * i)

<span class='-comment'>// Multiplication</span>
(<span class='-keyword'>a</span> + <span class='-builtin'>b</span>*i) * (<span class='-keyword'>c</span> + <span class='-builtin'>d</span>*i) = (<span class='-keyword'>a*c - b*d</span> + <span class='-builtin'>a*d + b*c</span> * i)
            </code>

            <h2>Back to the Mandlebrot Set</h2>
            <p>
                Each point of the Mandlebrot set is a result of a test based on the equation above, 
                run 200-300 times, and mapped to the screen. 
                (the set starts at -2 and ends at 2 on both axes) 
                Basically for every pixel you run the equation a few hundred times, and test the 
                resulting numbers distance to (0,0) to see if it's greater than 2, if it is, 
                you can color that point the background color, otherwise, it's in the set! 
                you can color it the set color (The Black Part)!
            </p>
            <img src="./images/projects/Mandlebrot set.png" alt="The Final Product">
            
            <h2>What About the Colored Part?</h2>
            <p>
                To get the colors on the outside of the set, 
                you need to count how many iterations it took to get that far away 
                (you can just return the 'i' in your for loop when the result's distance to 
                the origin is > 2) and color the outside pixels based on that number.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a trick to color it anything you want:
            </p>
            <code class='math'>
i = the_number_of_iterations_before_dist_exceeded_2
color = rgb(i * red, i * green, i * blue)
            </code>

            <h2>The Final Code</h2>
            <p>
                Here is what the final program should look like, what else can you change?
                What happens when you change the power of <code>z</code>?
            </p>
            <code>
for (x, y) every_pixel { // keep x and y between 2 and -2
    c = new ComplexNumber(x, y)
    x = new ComplexNumber(0, 0)

    color = iterate()
    color = rgb(color * red, color * green, color * blue)

    draw_pixel(x, y, color)
}

function iterate() {
    repeat 200-300 times {
        c = ComplexNumber.pow(z, 2) + c
        if dist(c, (0,0)) >= 2 {
            return i
        }
        return 0
    }
}
            </code>
