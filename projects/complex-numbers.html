        <h1>Complex Numbers</h1>
        <p>
            This is an interactive introduction 
            to the world of complex numbers.

            I've always found these numbers to be a very natural,
            and not to mention useful, extension of the real numbers 
            that we're used to.
        
            That said, the usual textbook introduction skips over
            the most important, and most intuitive part of 
            the entire concept!
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's start by going over what we know. Let's start with real numbers. 
            You probably have a very intuitive understanding of 
            what multiplication and addition does to numbers, but here I'm going to ask you to 
            think about it in a different way, one you might not have considered before.
        </p>

        <h2>Visualizing Numbers</h2>
        <p>
            What <i>is</i> a negative number? What does multiplying by a negative do visually?
            play around with this interactive number line and see if you can come up with 
            a meaningful answer.
        </p>

        <canvas class="powers-of-minus-one"></canvas>
        <div class="interactive-controls powers-of-minus-one-controls">
            <button> \(&times; (-1)\)</button>
            <button> \(&times; (-2)\)</button>
            <button> \(&times;2\)</button>
            <button> \(+1 \)</button>
            <button> \(-1 \)</button>
            <button> reset </button>
        </div>

        <p>
            Hopefully you noticed that multiplying by -1 
            rotates the number 180 degrees, regardless of 
            if the number was already negative, and addition
            and subtraction always move the number to the right
            and left respectively. Thinking of it this way adds 
            an intuitive reason for a negative times a negative 
            being positive, because it rotates halfway round twice,
            making it all the way back to the positive side of the 
            number line.
        </p>
        <p>
            So adding moves the number in the direction the other number
            is pointing, and multiplication rotates the number by the amount 
            the other number was rotated.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number one has
            an angle of 0, because anything times one is itself, so no
            rotation is done. the angle of -1 is 180&deg;, because it 
            turns a number to face the opposite direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its also interesting to note that the length of the number 
            follows normal multiplication, ignoring the negatives, because 
            the negatives only change the direction, not the size, of the number.

            That's why we're using a length of 1, because that means whatever size 
            the number was, is multiplied by one, and doesn't change, and the result is 
            only rotation, otherwise the length would change too.
        </p>

        <h2>What about other directions?</h2>
        <p>
            What if we turn a different amount, say, 90 degrees?
            Now that we know we can rotate nunbers, why stick to the 
            one dimensional number line?
        </p>
        <p>
            We already have the tools we need to find this number. 
            We now know that multiplying two numbers 
            adds their angles together, and we know that -1 has an angle of 180 degrees.
            So the number we're looking for (with an angle of 90) 
            would be multiplied with itself to get an angle of (90&deg;+90&deg;=180&deg;),

            in other words, the nuber we need is the square root of minus one, usually written 
            as "\(i\)"
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            So what can we do with this number? well, as you saw in the number line before, 
            adding moves the number in the direction of whatever's been added. so now we have
            a number pointing up, we can leave the number line.
        </p>

        <canvas class="complex-plane"></canvas>
        <div class="interactive-controls complex-plane-controls">
            <button> \(&times; (-1)\)</button>
            <button> \(&times; (-i)\)</button>
            <button> \(&times;i\)</button>
            <button> \(+1 \)</button>
            <button> \(-1 \)</button>
            <button> \(+i \)</button>
            <button> \(-i \)</button>
            <button> reset </button>
        </div>

        <p>
            This is what people mean when they say the Complex Plane, it refers to 
            the space we can use that's off the normal number line.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you may have noticed that we can only rotate by specific angles 
            (multiples of 90&deg;) how do we chose any amount to rotate by?
