        <h1> The True Meaning of Integration </h1>

        <p>
            Did you know the fact that the integral calculates the area under a graph is just a mathematical coincidence? When Newton was 
            creating calculus for use in his kinematic model of physics (\(\vec{F}=m\vec{a}\)) he likely had no idea that it was adding up the area
            under the graph. Here is an alternate way to think about the integral, much more applicable to physics that tries to explain what 
            an integral actually means, and how it applies to physics, in a more intuitive way.
